# Event may spawn between 0 and 10,000 ticks of a day.
# When it does spawn, based on the config, we may apply
# the darkness effect on players before abruptly setting
# time to midnight. Furthermore, we start thunder without
# rain. Event lasts as long as is stated. All sounds stop too.
#
# During the event, we either have absolute silence or
# some nether-theme ambience. Light will dim. No new entities
# spawn during this event. While in other worlds everything
# functions as usual.
#
# At event stop, we play some rewind sound and set time back
# to where it was before the event started.
